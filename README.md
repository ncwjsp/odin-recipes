# odin-recipes

This is my first project to practice the foundation HTML knowledge I have acquired.
In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Skill demonstrated : Basic HTML

After project reviewing :
I considered this project an easy one but it was very useful too!

What I've learned from doing this project :
    - How to build basic structure for webpages
    - Getting familiar with
        - Anchor tags
        - Image elements
        - Unordered lists and Ordered lists
        - The importance of headings 1 to 6
        - How to use a paragraph properly

And that's it for this project.
Thank you for observing my small pieces of work :)
